## Known Issues
1. When a user makes a tag it comes out as a string, not individual items in an array.

## Features that still need to be implemented
1. The photo sizes currently have no functionality.
2. Implement input type file for uploading images.
3. Ability to edit user's profiles.
4. Let users browse other user's profiles.
5. Tags on show page to be searchable on click.
6. Still need more CSS (hover effects on links/buttons)
